IP Address

An IPv4 address has 32 bits, split into 4 octets (8 bits each).
8 bits → 2⁸ = 256 values (0–255)

192.168.10.1
192  = 11000000
168  = 10101000
1    = 00000001
10   = 00001010
11000000.10101000.00000001.00001010

Network ID vs Host ID
Every IPv4 address is split into:
Network portion → identifies the network
Host portion → identifies the device

Example:
192.168.1.10/24
Binary:
Network: 11000000.10101000.00000001
Host:    00001010

Two special host values:
All 0s → Network address (192.168.1.0)
All 1s → Broadcast address (192.168.1.255)
These cannot be assigned to devices.

5. Subnet masks (the knife that cuts networks)
A subnet mask tells us:
“Which bits belong to the network?”

Example:
255.255.255.0

Binary:
11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000

That’s a /24 network:
24 network bits
8 host bits
Rule of sanity
Network bits → continuous 1s
Host bits → continuous 0s
No mixing allowed (nature is strict here)

6. CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)
CIDR killed rigid classes and replaced them with logic.
Notation:
192.168.1.0/26

Meaning:
26 bits → network
6 bits → host
Hosts = 2⁶ − 2 = 62
Binary mask:
11111111.11111111.11111111.11000000

CIDR lets you design networks precisely instead of wasting addresses like it’s 1995.

7. Public vs Private IP addresses
Some IP ranges are not routable on the internet.
Private ranges:
10.0.0.0/8
172.16.0.0 – 172.31.255.255
192.168.0.0/16
These live behind NAT (your router plays translator between private and public worlds).

8. Loopback & special addresses
127.0.0.1 → loopback (talking to yourself)
0.0.0.0 → unspecified / default route
255.255.255.255 → limited broadcast
Loopback is a philosophical gem:
the network equivalent of thinking aloud.

9. Binary math you must be comfortable with
Subnetting lives and dies on powers of two.

Bits	Values
1	2

3	8
4	16
5	32
6	64
7	128
8	256

Usable hosts formula:
2^(host bits) - 2

Why minus 2?
One for network address
One for broadcast

Host bits: 24
Hosts per network: 16,777,214
0xxxxxxx.xxxxxxxx.xxxxxxxx.xxxxxxxx


Class B
Range: 128.0.0.0 – 191.255.255.255
First bits: 10
Network bits: 16
Host bits: 16
Hosts per network: 65,534
Binary pattern:
10xxxxxx.xxxxxxxx.xxxxxxxx.xxxxxxxx

Class C
Range: 192.0.0.0 – 223.255.255.255
First bits: 110
Network bits: 24
Host bits: 8
Hosts per network: 254
Binary pattern:
110xxxxx.xxxxxxxx.xxxxxxxx.xxxxxxxx

Class D (Multicast)
Range: 224.0.0.0 – 239.255.255.255
First bits: 1110
Used for multicast, not host addressing

First bits: 1111
Reserved, not used in normal networking
